# Responsive Modal Gallery
This project was made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The modal window displays the image clicked by the user and it is close when the user clicks a button at the top right or anywhere outside the displayed image.

The script contains three events that allow the events described above:

1. Close a modal window when the modal's button is clicked;
2. Open a modal window and display the selected image;  
3. Close a modal window when the user clicks outside image displayed.
